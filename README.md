# odin-landing-page

In this project I'll be showcasing what I've learned in these lessons about CSS Flexbox.
I'll need to utilize most everything I've learned to complete this project and have to google some things I may not have encountered yet.

My plan is to make the landing page as their design calls and going back to custom style this myself. I want to focus on getting the project done and understanding how and why everything works together.
